Lets reveiw the files in the `src` directory to find the remaing hard coded strings that are used as messages and move them to the `locales/en/messages.json` file.

Lets start by:

review the files and find any file that contains hard coded strings that are used as messages.

create a list of the files that contain hard coded strings.

work through each file and identify the hard coded strings, and migrate them to the `locales/en/messages.json` file.
